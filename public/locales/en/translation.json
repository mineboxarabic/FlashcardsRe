      "title": "What is Spaced Repetition?",
      "content": "Spaced Repetition is a learning technique that involves reviewing information at increasing intervals. When you first learn something, you review it frequently. As you remember it better, the time between reviews gets longer. This process interrupts the natural forgetting curve, moving information from your short-term to your long-term memory much more efficiently than traditional studying."

    "learningProcess": {
      "title": "The NeuroCards Learning Process",
      "content": "Our app uses a sophisticated algorithm (a modified version of SM-2) to manage this process for you. Every time you review a card, you rate how well you knew the answer ('Again', 'Hard', 'Good', 'Easy').\n\n- **Good/Easy:** You remembered it well. We'll show you this card again further in the future.\n- **Hard:** You struggled but got it. We'll show it to you again soon, but not as soon as a failed attempt.\n- **Again:** You forgot. The card's interval is reset, and you'll see it very soon to re-learn it."

    "yourSession": {
      "title": "Your Study Session",
      "content": "When you start a 'Due Cards' study session, NeuroCards automatically gathers all the cards that are scheduled for review today (or are overdue). This ensures you're always focusing on the information that's at the highest risk of being forgotten, making your study time incredibly effective."

    "gettingStarted": {
      "title": "How to Get the Most Out of It",
      "content": "1. **Create Cards:** Make your own cards or use the AI generator. Be concise but clear.\n2. **Study Consistently:** Try to clear your 'Due Cards' queue every day. Even 5-10 minutes makes a huge difference.\n3. **Be Honest:** Rate your recall honestly. The algorithm works best when it has accurate data about your memory.\n4. **Trust the Process:** Don't worry about which cards to study. Just hit 'Study' and let the algorithm guide you."
